# Pinterest-Flask
A Pinterest Clone made using Flask in Python that deals with pins and has embedded AI at its core end.

## Motivation 
This project was made as a part of creating something unique with my Flask skills essentially after being proficient in developing applications with Django. Also, I am not that much
fluent with developing Frontend but knew bits-and-pieces of Bootstrap. So, I wanted to create a masterpiece of my work and what could be more appealing than Pinterest clone. 
Since Pinterest is all about organizing and rendering images this was a must-try.

### Code Dependancies
The code dependancies for the project are : 
<ul>
<li>Python 3.5+
<li>Flask 
<li>sklearn
<li>scikit-learn
<li>Pillow
<li>gunicorn
<li>Flask-SQLAlchemy for the SQlite database management
<li>pandas 
<li>numpy
</ul>

## AI feature
I have used Collaborative filtering for generating recommended images in the home screen for logged-in users.

## Features 
The project has most of the features as in original Pinterest site other than "BOARDS" section. 
<ul>
<li>Material UI
<li>Implemented Disqus comment system
<li>Save images(pins)
<li>Admin can upload specific advertisements and thoughts
<li>Fluid experience
<li>Track user activity for generating recommendations based on similar behaviour
</ul>

## What is Left to be Done ?
The project is still under development although it may look as if complete. <br>The following features need to be added.
<ul><li>Search functionality (enhanced) <li>Usage of OpenCV to generated similar images in "MORE LIKE THIS" section
<li>Optimization for mobile devices</ul>

### Attributions 
I would like to mention the following sources whose artifacts I have used to make this project
<ul>
<li>Pinterest for using the Logo on the site (Since this is just a small try-out clone attempt, so I wanted to keep things as original as possible)
<li>https://github.com/wowthemesnet/template-pintereso-bootstrap-html repo has been very beneficial for generating the index template, although the entirety of it was modified 
but  was helpful in giving the rough idea.
</ul>
